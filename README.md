# StaticSecurityAnalysis
Static Security Analysis of Open Source Projects using Bandit

## Overview
Automated security analysis for Open Source Python codebases using Bandit. Scans code for common vulnerabilities and generates detailed reports in multiple formats.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone and navigate to the project
git clone https://github.com/priyadharshini18-hub/StaticSecurityAnalysis.git
cd StaticSecurityAnalysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Run Security Analysis

```bash
python scripts/run_bandit_analysis.py
```

Edit the script to specify your target repository path (line 57-58):
```python
run_bandit_scan("httpie/cli", "httpie")
```

**Generates:**
- `full_scan_*.json` - Complete JSON report
- `full_scan_*.html` - HTML report
- `full_scan_*.txt` - Text report
- `high_severity_*.txt` - High severity issues only

### 2. Filter Security Vulnerabilities

```bash
python filter_security_vulnerabilities.py
```

Update the input file path (line 91) to match your generated report timestamp.

**Output:** `security_vulnerabilities.json` with filtered results and severity breakdown.

## Example Output

```
▶ Running: Full JSON Report
  ✓ Completed

Filtered 15 security vulnerabilities from 45 total issues

Severity breakdown:
  HIGH: 8
  MEDIUM: 7
```
